This is the Libre Tower TO-DO list, containing all of the things that need to be UNIQUELY recreated to be somewhat like the Sage 2019 demo.
Some entries also contain to-dos for objects. This is simply to make finding issues or complaints easier.

TO DO
* Finish AGM Facility [basically DONE]
* Finish and polish player sprites
	* Idle animations (like 2 or 3)
	* Pre-mach 3 running animation
	* Wallslam animation
	* Jumping animation
	* Crouching idle, walk, and jump
	* Hurt walk
	* Dash attack animation
* Make some new damn sprites!
	* Debris for metal blocks
	* 
* Add better assets for AGM Facility's background
* Improve the AGM Facility tileset
* Add/Replace the following music:
	* AGM Facility song (uses Freedoom MAP09 music)
	* Armory song [DONE, kind of]
	* Secret songs for the 3 aforementioned levels [DONE for AGM and Armory]
	* Title screen music
* Make concepts/sprites for enemies
* Make concepts/sprites for the Knight transformation, as well as any others that are to be made... or needed
* Fix some bugs
	* Platforms take priority over actual solids when colliding, causing issues, particularly with destructibles.
	* On the first time the game runs without a preexisting save file, the Fullscreen option reads "undefined", going to the Audio menu causes a crash, and so does highlighting Panic Shake on Effects.
