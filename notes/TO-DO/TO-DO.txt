This is the Libre Tower TO-DO list, containing all of the things that need to be UNIQUELY recreated to be somewhat like the Sage 2019 demo.
Some entries also contain to-dos for objects. This is simply to make finding issues or complaints easier.

TO DO:
* Add a Pizzascape replacement
* Add an Ancient Cheese replacement [DONE in the form of the Armory]
* Finish AGM Facility [basically DONE]
* Finish and polish player sprites
* Add better assets for AGM Facility's background
* Add a tileset for AGM Facility [DONE]
* Add/Replace the following music:
	* AGM Facility song (uses Freedoom MAP09 music)
	* Pizzascape Replacement song
	* Armory song [DONE, kind of]
	* Secret songs for the 3 aforementioned levels [DONE for AGM and Armory]
	* Title screen music
	* Probably a better escape theme (keep the harp leitmotif please) [DONE]
* Make concepts/sprites for enemies
* Make concepts/sprites for the Knight transformation, as well as any others that are to be made... or needed
* Embed platforms directly into the collision code [DONE]
* Fix some bugs
	* When trying to run while directly next to destroyables, the player is locked into a running state
	* In ARMORY_5, the destroyables on the platform can cause the player to get stuck if ran into
	* Player is considered "on ground" if mid-air and colliding with a platform
	* Platforms take priority over actual solids when colliding, causing issues, particularly destructibles.
* REWRITE THE COLLISION CODE! It sucks and it's buggy as shit.
