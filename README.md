# Libre Tower

Libre Tower is a project inspired by the likes of [Freedoom](https://github.com/freedoom/freedoom) to make a free, open-source Pizza Tower-*like* game. Not just free as in no cost, but as stated by Freedoom's own readme, free to copy, modify, and redistribute without needed permission, as long as it is shared alike/with the same license.

The raw assets for the project can be found at [Applemunch/LibreTower-Assets](https://github.com/Applemunch/LibreTower-Assets).
