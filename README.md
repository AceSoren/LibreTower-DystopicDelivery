# Libre Tower

Libre Tower is a project inspired by the likes of [Freedoom](https://github.com/freedoom/freedoom) to make a free, open-source Pizza Tower-like game. Not just free as in price free, but as stated by Freedoom's own readme, free to copy, modify, and redistribute without needed permission, as long as the license is still intact.
